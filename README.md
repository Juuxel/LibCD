LibCapableData, or LibCD, is a suite of hooks to make data packs easier for both mod and pack developers. LibCD conditions allow for conditional loading of data pack elements.

## Conditions
Conditions are a framework for data-driven conditional loading of data pack elements. They're added with a `.mcmeta` system like resource pack metadata is. Tags are also given a `libcd` block for conditional entries outside of all-or-nothing loading.
